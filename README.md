Catch Calculator is a utility app that works with pokemon Go. The user can enter candy number and select a pokemon from the gridView and the calculation will show how many more catches are needed to be able to evolve that pokemon to the further evolutions. The user can also select from checkboxes if they are transferring or using pinaps upon catch.
